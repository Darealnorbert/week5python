# Week 5 Assignment

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including class creation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features

- **Smartphone Class**:  
  Represents a smartphone with attributes for brand, model, and operating system.  
  Includes methods to make calls, send messages, and install apps.

- **Vehicles, Car, and Plane Classes**:  
  Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism.  
  The `Vehicles` base class is extended by `Car` and `Plane`, each implementing a different version of the `move()` method.

## Usage

Run the Python script:

```sh
python week5assignment.py
```

### Example Output

```
Calling 123-456-7890 from iPhone 13
Sending message to 987-654-3210: Hello!
```

## Files

- [`week5assignment.py`](week5assignment.py): Main Python script with class definitions and example usage.

## Assignment Instructions

1. **Design Your Own Class**:  
   Create a class representing anything you like (e.g., Smartphone).  
   Add attributes and methods, and use constructors for unique values.  
   Add inheritance to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

2. **Polymorphism Challenge**:  
   Create a program with animals or vehicles that share an action (like `move()`), but each class defines# week5python
